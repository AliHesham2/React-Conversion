            Over the past few decades Japan has made significant contributions to the culture of the UK and other Western countries. As well as revolutionising our cars, computers, and cartoon characters Japan has also broadened our culinary knowledge with the introduction of its delicious and highly unique cuisine.

            <h2 class="section-title">Miso Soup</h2>
            <p>Few Japanese dishes are consumed more often or more consistently than miso soup. 
            Made from a combination of miso paste (a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soy beans) 
            and dashi broth, miso soup is served as a side dish with traditional 
            Japanese-style breakfasts, lunches and dinners.
            </p>
            <p>The complex savoury flavours of the soup help to enhance the umami of the main dishes 
            with which it is served. To give the miso soup a little more body, several complementary 
            toppings are normally added to it, such as green onion, wakame seaweed, and firm tofu.

                    <p>There are two main kinds of tofu: silken and regular. Silken tofu also called 
                    soft, silk, or Japanese-style tofu has a softer consistency than regular tofu and will 
                    fall apart if not handled carefully.

                    <h3 class="skill-title">Miso Paste</h3>
                    <p>You’ll find this fermented soybean paste in the refrigerated section of Asian
                    markets and most grocery stores. For this recipe, look for white miso paste.
                    Because it’s fermented for less time than darker types of miso, such as red
                    miso, it has a milder, sweeter flavor that’s delicious in this simple soup.

                    <h3 class="skill-title">Wakame algae</h3>
                    <p>Wakame is a species of sea vegetable, commonly referred to as seaweed, extensively 
                    used in Japanese and other Asian cuisines, especially in soups, salads, and snacks, but 
                    also as a seasoning. Wakame is deep green in color; it is occasionally referred to 
                    as "sea mustard," likely because it resembles mustard greens when cooked, but not 
                    because of its mild flavor, which is unlike the peppery vegetable.
