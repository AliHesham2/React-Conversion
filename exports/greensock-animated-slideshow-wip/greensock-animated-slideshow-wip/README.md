A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/aderaaij/pen/wKVaKE](https://codepen.io/aderaaij/pen/wKVaKE).

A fullscreen, sort of responsive, slideshow animated with Greensocks TweenLite/Tweenmax. 

This is work in progress, currently working on how to best pevent the slidein animations from firing when users click the next/prev button repeatedly.
